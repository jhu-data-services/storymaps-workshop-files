# How to Download Workshop Files

The files are contained in two different folders in this repository.
- _IndividualStoryMapsWorkshopFiles_ contains each of the files in a format you can preview and download one-by-one. This may be helpful for reference, but we do not recommend it for initial workshop setup.

- _AllStoryMapsWorkshopFiles.zip_ is a compressed (zipped) folder containing all the files you need for the workshop, as a single download. Please use this option to get ready for the workshop.

## Download all files
1. Click the link for [AllStoryMapsWorkshopFiles.zip](AllStoryMapsWorkshopFiles.zip)
2. Click the Download button on the upper right of the preview window to download the compressed folder.

3. Follow the instructions in your operating system to Extract All or Unzip the folder before the workshop.
4. Make sure to save the files somewhere you can find them easily during the workshop.
